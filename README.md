A javascript timed code quiz



As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

- The URL of the functional, deployed application.

- The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.

### Hints

- You will need to use `setInterval` for the timer.
- You will need to use `localStorage`. What is the part of app that needs to persist?
- You will need use event delegation.
- The Week 4 ToDo's application (`28-Stu_Local-Storage-Todos`) has examples of `localStorage` and event delegation.
